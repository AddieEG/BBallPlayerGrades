# Basketball Performance Metrics Calculator
This R script calculates performance grades for basketball players based on various statistics.
## Description
The script reads a CSV file containing basketball game statistics, processes the data, and assigns grades to players based on specified weights and scales. The resulting grades are then saved in a new Excel file.
## Customization
You can customize the weights and scales for different player positions (Forward, Guard, Center) to reflect different position priorities.
